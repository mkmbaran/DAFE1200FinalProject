        <h2>Our solution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We at Urban CROPS have come up with 3 solutions.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rely more on Urban Farming</li>
                <li>Create new, environmentally conscious jobs</li>
                <li>App that connects gardens/urban farms, search jobs, find workers etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We believe that an increased focus on urban farming can help us combat the economic hit of the COVID-19 pandemic, by creating new, environmentally conscious and sustainable jobs. This solution allows us to simultaneously revert our political gaze back to the climate and environment, while also helping the economy.
            <br>
            Our secondary goal is to fulfill the needs of the urban poor, by providing better and easier access to healthy, organic produce.
            <br>
            The aim of our app is to create a reliable center for urban farming, not only in-between farmers, but also for consumers and investors.
